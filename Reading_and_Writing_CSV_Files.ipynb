    "# Reading and Writing CSV Files\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:**\n",
    "CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are a common data format used to store tabular data. Each line in a CSV file corresponds to a row in the table, and each field in the row is separated by a comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts and Definitions:**\n",
    "- **CSV File:** A text file that uses a comma to separate values.\n",
    "- **Pandas Library:** A Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- **DataFrame:** A two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure in Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading CSV Files:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reading a CSV file\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('path_to_csv_file.csv')\n",
    "print(df.head())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `pd.read_csv()` is used to read a CSV file and convert it into a DataFrame.\n",
    "- `df.head()` prints the first few rows of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Writing CSV Files:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Writing a DataFrame to a CSV file\n",
    "df.to_csv('path_to_output_csv_file.csv', index=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `df.to_csv()` writes the DataFrame to a CSV file.\n",
    "- `index=False` ensures that the index column is not written to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Examples with Comments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 1: Reading a CSV file\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('example.csv')\n",
    "print(\"Data read from CSV file:\")\n",
    "print(df.head())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2: Writing a DataFrame to a CSV file\n",
    "df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)\n",
    "print(\"Data written to output.csv\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualizations:**\n",
    "If applicable, add any visualizations that help understand the data, such as plotting a graph using Matplotlib or Seaborn.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Real Use-Case Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use-Case 1: Sales Data Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:**\n",
    "A company wants to analyze its sales data stored in a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Implementation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Reading sales data\n",
    "sales_df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analyzing sales data\n",
    "total_sales = sales_df['sales_amount'].sum()\n",
    "print(f\"Total Sales: ${total_sales}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of Results and Challenges:**\n",
    "- The script reads sales data and calculates the total sales amount.\n",
    "- Potential challenges include handling missing data or incorrect file paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use-Case 2: Customer Data Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:**\n",
    "Managing customer data for a marketing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Implementation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Reading customer data\n",
    "customers_df = pd.read_csv('customers.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Filtering customers based on criteria\n",
    "target_customers = customers_df[customers_df['age'] > 30]\n",
    "print(\"Target Customers:\")\n",
    "print(target_customers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of Results and Challenges:**\n",
    "- The script filters customers based on age criteria.\n",
    "- Challenges may include handling large datasets or ensuring data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read a CSV file named `employees.csv`.\n",
    "- Calculate the average salary of employees.\n",
    "- Write the filtered DataFrame of employees with a salary above the average to a new CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read a CSV file named `products.csv`.\n",
    "- Find the product with the highest price.\n",
    "- Write a DataFrame containing only this product to a new CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Reading employees data\n",
    "employees_df = pd.read_csv('employees.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculating average salary\n",
    "average_salary = employees_df['salary'].mean()\n",
    "print(f\"Average Salary: ${average_salary}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Filtering employees with salary above average\n",
    "high_salary_employees = employees_df[employees_df['salary'] > average_salary]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Writing to a new CSV file\n",
    "high_salary_employees.to_csv('high_salary_employees.csv', index=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Reading products data\n",
    "products_df = pd.read_csv('products.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Finding product with highest price\n",
    "highest_price_product = products_df.loc[products_df['price'].idxmax()]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a DataFrame for the product\n",
    "highest_price_product_df = pd.DataFrame([highest_price_product])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Writing to a new CSV file\n",
    "highest_price_product_df.to_csv('highest_price_product.csv', index=False)\n",
