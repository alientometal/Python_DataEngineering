    "# Error and Exception Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are (at least) two types of errors: syntax errors and exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Also known as parsing errors, these are perhaps the most common kind of complaint you get while learning Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> while True print('Hello world')\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n",
    "    while True print('Hello world')\n",
    "                   ^\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors detected during execution are called exceptions. Examples include ZeroDivisionError, TypeError, ValueError, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 10 * (1/0)\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> '2' + 2\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle exceptions, Python has `try`...`except` statements. Here is a basic example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = 1 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    x = 0  # We handle the error by assigning 0 to x\n",
    "```"
