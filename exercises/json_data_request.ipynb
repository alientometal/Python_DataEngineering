    "### Exercise: Retrieve and Manage JSON Data from a GitHub Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "In this exercise, you will write a Python script to retrieve JSON data from a specified directory in a GitHub repository. This will test your ability to work with APIs, handle file directories, and manage basic data engineering tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "Here is a partially completed script. Your task is to fill in the missing parts of the script to successfully download the files from the GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup the repository and branch details:**\n",
    "   - Repository: `alientometal/training_datasets`\n",
    "   - Branch: `main`\n",
    "   - Directory: `data`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Complete the Script:**\n",
    "   - Fill in the missing parts of the provided script to download the files from the specified GitHub directory.\n",
    "   - Ensure that the script handles the creation of the local directory if it does not exist.\n",
    "   - Write a function to download individual files from the GitHub repository."
